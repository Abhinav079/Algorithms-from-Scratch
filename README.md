# Algorithms from Scratch Repository

Welcome to the **Algorithms from Scratch Repository**!

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) containing implementations of various algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is coded without relying on external libraries, providing a clear and educational resource for understanding the fundamental principles behind these algorithms.

Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer interested in algorithmic details, this repository aims to serve as a learning hub. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific algorithm. Within each folder, you will find the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and any accompanying resources or documentation.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Implement a new algorithm or enhance an existing one.
4. Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook is well-documented and includes explanations for each step.
5. Submit a pull request, describing the changes you made and the purpose of the contribution.
