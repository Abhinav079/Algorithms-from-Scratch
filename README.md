# Algorithms from Scratch Repository

Welcome to the **Algorithms from Scratch Repository**!

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) containing implementations of various algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is coded without relying on external libraries, providing a clear and educational resource for understanding the fundamental principles behind these algorithms.

Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer interested in algorithmic details, this repository aims to serve as a learning hub. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific algorithm. Within each folder, you will find the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and any accompanying resources or documentation.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Implement a new algorithm or enhance an existing one.
4. Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook is well-documented and includes explanations for each step.
5. Submit a pull request, describing the changes you made and the purpose of the contribution.

## Algorithms List

- **Algorithm 1:** K-Means Clustering
  - K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster while maximizing the variance between clusters. It is widely employed in various fields, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.

- **Algorithm 2:** Linear Regression
  - Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, making it a fundamental algorithm in regression analysis. Linear Regression is widely applied in areas such as finance, economics, and social sciences.
